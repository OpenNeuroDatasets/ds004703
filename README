RECORDING SETUP

These data were collected from June 2018 to August 2019.

For all patients, a scalp electrode was used for referencing and ground. These were 13mm, 2.5M single lead subdermal electrodes made by Rochester Electro-Medical with serial number S81025-A-24RM.

Depth electrodes were manufactured by Ad-Tech and are Spencer Probe depth electrodes. Each electrode has 10 leads evenly spaced 3-7mm apart. 

With the exception of patients SD012 and SD022, all implants are depth electrodes. Patients SD012 and SD022 had grid and strip electrodes implanted in addition to several depth electrodes.

Any channel names beginning with ``C'' were not used and should be dropped from analyses.

TASK

Participants passively listened to 30-45s passages of conversational speech and  verbally answered a 2AC content question after each passage. 6 blocks with 7 passages per block.

MISSING DATA

Anatomical scans for particpant SD012 are not available due to excessive movement artifacts.
